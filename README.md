Hi mates, I'm Yuvaraaj

I am a Second year student at MCET Pollachi, pursuing my Bachelors in COMPUTER SCIENCE.
And also a curious and an open person to gain new skills.
Now I'm an active budding App Developer at SPOTKNACK
Besides Tech Skills, currently I'm moulding myself to a Professional Person.
Also I'm swimming in Japanese Art, ORIGAMI, my unique and most favourite Hobby.
